# 📝 Task Manager App

A fully responsive and powerful Task Manager web application built with **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **EJS**. This project demonstrates real-world **backend development** concepts such as:

- RESTful APIs  
- CRUD operations  
- Express routing  
- UUID handling  
- Dynamic templating with EJS

## 📚 What I Learned & Implemented

This project is a practical reflection of my backend journey. It integrates all the concepts I’ve learned so far:

### 📦 Backend (Node.js + Express)
- Understanding **What is REST?**
- Creating **RESTful APIs**
- Implementing **CRUD Operations**:
  - 🆕 Create Route
  - 📋 Read (Index & Show) Routes
  - ✏️ Update Route
  - ❌ Delete Route
- Middleware usage with `app.use()`
- Routing with `app.get()`, `app.post()`, `app.put()`, `app.delete()`
- Redirects and unique ID generation using `uuid`

### 🎨 Frontend (EJS Templates)
- **Templating engine:** EJS
- Dynamic content rendering
- Form handling for task creation & editing
- Conditional rendering & looping
- Full responsiveness for all screen sizes
